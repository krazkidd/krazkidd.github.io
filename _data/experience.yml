      <li>Designed a high-throughput mapping feature using MapBox GL JS. Used MySQL spatial indexes and queries behind a simple cache (to reduce query result set) and parallelized GeoJSON AJAX requests, producing a map that could display thousands of geographic assets in real time as the user panned and zoomed around the globe.</li>
      <li>Established an asynchronous design paradigm for other developers by writing ASP.NET MVC base controller classes and a complementary JavaScript AJAX library.</li>
      <li>Ported a business-critical desktop form-building application to the web as a fast single-page user experience; business logic was reimagined as a REST-ful API and DevExtreme JavaScript widgets were used for the web client.</li>
      <li>Bootstrapped development of the next-gen mobile app with Xamarin Forms so the incoming mobile developer could download or sync a local database for further work.</li>
