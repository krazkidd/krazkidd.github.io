      <li>Designed and implemented Azure Pipelines (YAML-based CI/CD) for multiple scenarios: Nuget packages and debug symbols for shared libraries, deployment of ASP.NET Core web apps to internal IIS servers, deployment of Java-based Mule integration apps to Cloudhub, deployment of public-facing web apps to Azure App Services, and automated testing through unit tests and functional UI tests. Advocated for removal of dependency on IIS for deployments to lightweight cloud environments like Azure App Services per future guidance.</li>
      <li>Directed nearshore and offshore specialists in unlocking SOAP web service (provided by Fiserv XP2 banking core) and other more typical systems for new Mule integration efforts. Attended instructor-led MuleSoft training course to prepare. Co-led discussions on Git branching strategy and branch-based deployments to coordinate multiple contributors and CI/CD systems. Reviewed pull requests and alerted management of fragile implementations and hazards to scalability with an emphasis on the risks and costs of rework and billing inefficiencies of microservices in Anypoint Platform.</li>
      <li>Rewrote a PHP goal-tracking application with ASP.NET Core and Telerik JavaScript widget framework (Kendo UI). Received praise from executives for a successful launch before annual planning session.</li>
      <li>Recreated PHP intranet applications as web APIs with small amounts of custom jQuery code to make AJAX requests from new intranet site. Implemented CORS on API side and pass-through Windows authentication (Kerberos) in AJAX requests to maintain trustless infrastructure.</li>

    <ul class="resume-item-list">
      <li>Ported a business-critical desktop form-building application to the web as a fast single-page user experience. The back end was redesigned to be platform agnostic using a declarative protocol for a platform-specific renderer to draw the UI. For web client implementation, DevExpress JavaScript widget framework (DevExtreme) was used.</li>
      <li>Designed a high throughput mapping application using MapBox GL JS. On the back end, a simple cache minimizes expensive instantiations of legacy business objects. On the client side, asynchronous GeoJSON data requests are parallelized. With this front- and back-end work, the map is able to display thousands of geographic assets in real time even as the user pans and zooms around the globe.</li>
      <li>Formalized an AJAX-first design paradigm by writing cooperative MVC controller and JavaScript classes for a snappy client-side experience with server-side business logic.</li>
      <li>Bootstrapped development of the next-gen mobile app with Xamarin Forms so the new mobile developer could download or sync a local database for further work.</li>
